\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Overview:}} \\

I am very pleased you will be participating in the \emph{Sports
  Analytics with R} tutorial at the \textcolor{Rblue}{useR!2017 Conference} . The tutorial is just a few days
away. \\

In order that you get the most out of the experience, I've
provided some useful information about resources for the workshop and
some packages you will want to make sure to install by the day of the tutorial.

\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Before the Tutorial:}} \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Please make sure you will have a laptop with you and will be able to
use \textcolor{Rblue}{R} during the tutorial.
\item You should ensure that you have version 3.2 or higher of
  \textcolor{Rblue}{R} on the machine you will be using at the
  conference.
\item Please install the \textcolor{Rblue}{deuce} package from
  github, which has datasets we will be using during the
  tutorial. Depending on your connection speed, this may take several
  minutes to install so it is \emph{very important} to do this before July 4th. You
  can install using the \texttt{devtools} command:
\item[] \texttt{devtools::install\_github(`skoval$/$deuce')}.
\item If you want to be able to do all of the examples, please make
  sure you have installed the following packages and their
  dependencies: \textcolor{Rblue}{devtools},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{gtools}, \textcolor{Rblue}{lubridate},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{stringr}, \textcolor{Rblue}{dplyr},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{tidyr},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{rvest}, \textcolor{Rblue}{RSelenium},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{ggplot2}, \textcolor{Rblue}{ggthemes},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{plot3D}, \textcolor{Rblue}{caret},
  \textcolor{Rblue}{blogdown},  \textcolor{Rblue}{plotly}
\item You can install   \textcolor{Rblue}{blogdown} from github using:
\item[] \texttt{devtools::install\_github(`rstudio$/$blogdown')}. 
\item[] The others should be available on CRAN.
\item Using \textcolor{Rblue}{RSelenium} may require additional
  installation of Selenium serve, a java program. You can find the
  information on installation under `How do I run the Selenium Server`
  at \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/RSelenium-basics.html#how-do-i-run-the-selenium-server}
\end{itemize}


I will also have pdf copies of the lecture slides if you would like
them after the tutorial, please contact me.
